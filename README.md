This brief live drawing exercise was conducted for the purpose of abstracting a simple concept into self generating art. It is a small and simple framework to help build more complex visualizations.

This work was completed in partial fulfillment for the course Data Mining the City at Columbia University GSAPP in 2017. 

The code is written in Python and intended for execution on the Processing 3 IDE, which can be downloaded at https://www.processing.org/download/. Ensure that the Python mode is installed an enbaled (Java is enabled by default). Only the .pyde file is required for proper execution. Enjoy!
